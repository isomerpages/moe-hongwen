**Total Defence Day**

Total Defence Day (TDD) marks the day Singapore was surrendered to the Japanese in 1942 and serves to remind us that we must not take our safety and security lightly.

Singapore has remained safe and peaceful over the years because of the efforts of all Singaporeans. This is essentially Total Defence. Total Defence remains relevant because the threats faced today require all Singaporeans to step up and play their part. Our youths are encouraged to put Total Defence into action in their daily lives by reaching out to one another, forging new relationships and strengthening existing ones to keep Singapore strong and resilient because our greatest strength lies in the unity and resilience of our people.

**Racial Harmony Day**

Schools commemorate Racial Harmony Day on 21st July. On this day in 1964, Singapore saw racial riots. Racial Harmony Day serves to remind our pupils that social division costs us dearly and that race and religion are potential fault-lines in Singapore society. It is a day for schools to reflect on, and celebrate our success as a harmonious nation and society built on a rich diversity of cultures and heritages.

Students should learn to make friends with people of other races and religions and not make fun of people who are different. Students should also learn that in Singapore, people are treated equally regardless of their race and religion and they should also do the same. Students should appreciate the different cultures that make up Singapore.

National Day marks our Separation from Malaysia, and our emergence as an independent country in the community of nations. Since 1998, a National Day Ceremony was introduced in schools. This Ceremony aims to bring to the students a greater sense of the historical importance and solemnity of National Day. Schools conduct a **15-minute National Day Ceremony** which is more formal than the festivities that schools usually organise.

2a.       Values Education (VE)

Values are the foundation of CCE. School Leaders take the lead in emphasizing values during Assemblies. Through our VE packages, our Form Teachers guide pupils on behaviours they should display consistently. Good role models are highlighted during assembly at the end of each term.

2b.       Education and Career Guidance (ECG)

Pupils learn about different jobs in our employment landscape so that they learn good values in the world of work. Pupils also explore Educational Pathways in Singapore which will guide them in choice of post-primary education. Parents are invited to share on their work during our ECG Day.

2c.       Financial Literacy (Fin Lit)

Through our Fin Lit programme, pupils learn the differences between Needs and Wants, how to make wise spending choices and benefits of savings.

2d.       Sexuality Education (SEd)

SEd enables students to understand the physiological, social and emotional changes they experience as they mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships including those with members of the opposite sex, and make wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality matters.

3.          Character-Based Discipline

Discipline guides pupils in the internalisation of values and behaviours, so that they can learn and grow. Pupils also learn to take responsibility for their actions and work towards the goal of self-discipline.

4a.       CCE Lessons

Pupils learn values, knowledge and skills through CCE Lessons conducted in Chinese. Di Zi Gui is also infused in our CCE Lessons Curriculum. Pupils learn the importance of contributing to the community through our annual CNY Hong Bao Donation Drive.

4b.       Form Teacher Guidance Periods (FTGP)

During FTGP, Form Teachers engage pupils through One-to-One Interaction so as to strengthen Teacher-Student Relationship and guide pupils in the development of their Social and Emotional Competencies.

4c.       Values-In-Action (VIA)

Values-In-Action (VIA) is a learning experience in Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) that enhances students’ development as socially responsible citizens through ownership of their contribution to the community.
