to develop them to be good individuals and useful citizens.</p>
<h2>CCE Vision</h2>

<h3>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National Education (NE)</h3>
<p>National Education is part of a holistic education. It aims to develop
national cohesion, cultivate the instinct for survival as a nation and
instill in our students, confidence in our nation’s future. It also emphasises
on cultivating a sense of belonging and emotional rootedness to Singapore.</p>
<h4>4 main NE commemorative events:</h4>

<h4>Main programmes:</h4>
<h5>Cohort Learning Journeys (CLJs)</h5>
<h5>Total Defence Day</h5>
<p>Total Defence Day (TDD) marks the day Singapore was surrendered to the
Japanese in 1942 and serves to remind us that we must not take our safety
and security lightly.</p>
<p>Singapore has remained safe and peaceful over the years because of the
efforts of all Singaporeans. This is essentially Total Defence. Total Defence
remains relevant because the threats faced today require all Singaporeans
to step up and play their part. Our youths are encouraged to put Total
Defence into action in their daily lives by reaching out to one another,
forging new relationships and strengthening existing ones to keep Singapore
strong and resilient because our greatest strength lies in the unity and
resilience of our people.</p>

<h5>Racial Harmony Day</h5>
<p>Schools commemorate Racial Harmony Day on 21st July. On this day in 1964,
Singapore saw racial riots. Racial Harmony Day serves to remind our pupils
that social division costs us dearly and that race and religion are potential
fault-lines in Singapore society. It is a day for schools to reflect on,
and celebrate our success as a harmonious nation and society built on a
rich diversity of cultures and heritages.</p>
<p>Students should learn to make friends with people of other races and religions
and not make fun of people who are different. Students should also learn
that in Singapore, people are treated equally regardless of their race
and religion and they should also do the same. Students should appreciate
the different cultures that make up Singapore.</p>

<h5>National Day</h5>
<p>National Day marks our Separation from Malaysia, and our emergence as
an independent country in the community of nations. Since 1998, a National
Day Ceremony was introduced in schools. This Ceremony aims to bring to
the students a greater sense of the historical importance and solemnity
of National Day. Schools conduct a 15-minute National Day Ceremony which
is more formal than the festivities that schools usually organise.</p>
<h3>2a. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Values Education (VE)</h3>
<p>Values are the foundation of CCE. School Leaders take the lead in emphasizing
values during Assemblies. The Monthly Focal Value Programme aims to build
the character of students by purposefully instilling our school values
through the highlighting of the behavioural indicators of each value. Good
role models are highlighted during assembly at the end of each month.</p>
<h3>2b. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Education and Career Guidance (ECG)</h3>
<p>Pupils learn about different jobs in our employment landscape so that
they learn good values in the world of work. Pupils also explore Educational
Pathways in Singapore which will guide them in choice of post-primary education.
Parents are invited to share about their work during our ECG Day.</p>
<h3>2c. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Financial Literacy (Fin Lit)</h3>
<p>Through our Fin Lit programme, pupils learn the differences between Needs
and Wants, how to make wise spending choices and benefits of savings.</p>
<h3>2d. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sexuality Education (SEd)</h3>
<p>SEd enables students to understand the physiological, social and emotional
changes they experience as they mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships
including those with members of the opposite sex, and make wise, informed
and responsible decisions on sexuality matters. Click <a href="https://hongwen.moe.edu.sg/moe-sexuality-education/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a> for
more information on Hong Wen School’s SEd programme.</p>
<h2>Character-Based Discipline</h2>
<p>Discipline guides pupils in the internalisation of values and behaviours,
so that they can learn and grow. Pupils also learn to take responsibility
for their actions and work towards the goal of self-discipline.</p>
<h3>4a. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; CCE (MTL) Lessons</h3>
<p>Pupils learn values, knowledge and skills through CCE(MTL) Lessons conducted
in Chinese. Di Zi Gui is also infused in our CCE Lessons Curriculum. Pupils
learn the importance of contributing to the community through our annual
CNY Hong Bao Donation Drive.</p>
<h3>4b. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Form Teacher Guidance Periods (CCE(FTGP))</h3>
<p>During (CCE(FTGP)), Form Teachers conduct lessons and engage pupils through
One-to-One Interaction so as to strengthen Teacher-Student Relationship
and guide pupils in the development of their Social and Emotional Competencies.</p>
<h3>4c. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Values-In-Action (VIA)</h3>
<p>Values-In-Action (VIA) is a learning experience in Character and Citizenship
Education (CCE) that enhances students’ development as socially responsible
citizens through ownership of their contribution to the community.</p>

Programme, Environment Programme and Aesthetics.</p>
