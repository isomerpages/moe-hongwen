<h2>Key Information</h2>
<h3>Intensive Reading Programme</h3>
<p>Graded Readers (P1-2)</p>
<p>The Graded Readers Programme is carried for all Primary 1 and Primary
2 students during curriculum time. It aims to instil in students a love
for reading, encouraging them to read with confidence and becoming successful
readers.</p>
<p>Graded reading serves a specific purpose: for readers to read enough material
at one level to develop sufficient fluency and other forms of linguistic
knowledge to enable them to move to a higher level.</p>
<p>Some benefits of graded reading include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>building reading speed,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing reading fluency and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the ability to move from working with words to working with ideas.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Pick and Tell (P1 &amp; 2)</h4>
<p>Pick and Tell is a programme to equip students with the skills needed
to develop their confidence and fluency in communicating in English. Students
engage in impromptu speaking as they select a random item and spontaneously
present their ideas about the item verbally using standard English.</p>

<h4>Learning Support Programme (P1-2)</h4>
<p>The Learning Support Programme is an early intervention programme which
aims to provide additional support in oracy for identified students. These
students attend lessons during curriculum to develop their reading, spelling
and comprehension skills through a structured programme.</p>
<h4>Reading – Moo-O (P1-2)</h4>
<p>Moo-O is a fun and interactive ICT-based programme where stories come
to life. Students become part of the stories and get to record themselves
reading the story as they take on the characters in the story. The fun
element in the programme encourages students to read expressively and the
ability to listen to and assess their own reading fluency allow them to
continuously improve themselves in their areas of growth.</p>
<h4>Reader’s Theatre (P3-4)</h4>
<p>Reader’s Theatre is part of our P3 and P4 English programmes. It aims
to encourage students to read with fluency and expression in a fun way
by taking on the characters in a story. The students develop social-emotional
competencies as they work and motivate one another while constantly improving
their reading and performance. Their growing confidence in themselves as
they proudly present their roles to their peers will be the most valuable
outcome in the learning process.</p>

<h4>Prepared Speech (P5-6)</h4>
<p>As part of the English Department’s efforts to encourage our students
to think critically and speak confidently, we have introduced a public
speaking programme called ‘Prepared Speech’ for our P5 &amp; P6 students.
Through this platform, the students are tasked to research and think critically
about a given topic, and then present their stand on the topic to their
classmates.</p>
<h3>SGEM@HW</h3>
<p>In order to encourage our students to learn English in a fun and interactive
way, the English department organises the Speak Good English Movement @
Hong Wen (SGEM @ HW) annually.</p>
<p>For one week, the students will get to learn to use good English through
the many activities and games planned during curriculum and recess.</p>
