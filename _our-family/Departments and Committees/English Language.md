#### **Key Information**


#### **Intensive Reading Programme**

Graded Readers (P1-2)

The Graded Readers Programme is carried for all Primary 1 and Primary 2 pupils during curriculum time. It aims to instill in pupils a love for reading, encouraging them to read with confidence and becoming successful readers.

Graded reading serves a specific purpose: for readers to read enough material at one level to develop sufficient fluency and other forms of linguistic knowledge to enable them to move to a higher level.

Some benefits of graded reading include:

*   building reading speed,
*   developing reading fluency and
*   the ability to move from working with words to working with ideas.

### **Oracy**

**Show and Tell (P1)**

Show and Tell provides every pupil with the opportunity to take the centre stage and present on a topic. The programme aims to develop pupils’ confidence as they listen to the presentations by their peers and learn to give constructive feedback to push the learning forward.

**Pick and Tell (P2)**

Pick and Tell is a programme newly implemented in 2019 to equip pupils with the skills needed to develop their confidence and fluency in communicating in English. Pupils engage in impromptu speaking as they select a random item and spontaneously present their spoken ideas about the item.

**Learning Support Programme (P1-2)**

The Learning Support Programme is an early intervention programme which aims to provide additional support in oracy for identified pupils. These pupils attend lessons during curriculum to develop their reading, spelling and comprehension skills through a structured programme.

Included in the Learning Support Programme are Reader’s Circle and Buddy Reading. These programmes, which are outside the formal curriculum, further promote a passion for reading in the pupils, as well as equip them with better reading skills.

**Public Speaking (P1-2)**

The P1 and P2 Public Speaking programme aims to provide each pupil with the opportunity to address an audience while exhibiting a level of confidence and self-assurance. The skills and lessons taught will encourage pupils to overcome their inhibitions and gradually develop into effective speakers who are able to speak with clarity and expression. Pupils enjoy a variety of speaking games as warm-up activities and develop SEL competencies as they encourage and learn from one another from the speaking activities.

**Reading – Moo-O (P1-2)**

Moo-O is a fun and interactive ICT-based programme where stories come to life. Pupils become part of the stories and get to record themselves reading the story as they take on the characters in the story. The fun element in the programme encourages pupils to read expressively and the ability to listen to and assess their own reading fluency allows them to continuously improve themselves in the area.

**Reader’s Theatre (P3-4)**

Reader’s Theatre is part of our P3 and P4 English programmes. It aims to encourage pupils to read with fluency and expression in a fun way by taking on the characters in a story. The pupils develop social-emotional competencies as they work and motivate one another while constantly improving their reading and performance. Their growing confidence in themselves as they proudly present their roles to their peers will be the most valuable outcome in the learning process.

**Prepared Speech (P5-6)**

As part of the English Department’s efforts to encourage our pupils to think critically and speak confidently, we have introduced a public speaking programme called ‘Prepared Speech’ for our P5 & P6 pupils. Through this platform, the pupils are tasked to research and think critically about a given topic, and then present their stand on the topic to their classmates.

#### **SGEM@HW**


 As part of the school’s efforts in encouraging our pupils to learn English in a fun and interactive way, the English department organises the Speak Good English Movement @ Hong Wen _(SGEM @ HW)_. 

For one week, the pupils will learn to use good English through the many activities planned during curriculum and recess.
