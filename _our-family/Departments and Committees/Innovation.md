Change is the only constant. As such, we want our pupils to develop the culture of Innovation in addition to Rootedness for the need to keep abreast of the new ideas and improvements happening around us. We also hope that our pupils see the need to constantly seek for improvements to gain a competitive edge in our society in future.

**HWS Innovation Process – EICS**

To provide a structure for pupils to approach project work without stifling creativity, Hong Wen School has developed an **Innovation Process – EICS (Empathise, Ideate, Create, Share)** based on the Design Thinking Process.

EICS provides a structure to scaffold pupils in their brainstorming, research and translation of ideas to complete project work independently.  The use of EICS also simplifies the project into smaller explicit segments to guide pupils to be self-directed in completing their project and enhances the generation of ideas to encourage creativity. This structure also develops pupils’ Social-Emotional Learning (SEL) and 21st Century Competencies, and instils values like perseverance and striving for excellence which are needed to needed to face the VUCA (Volatile, Uncertain, Complex and Ambiguous) world.

EICS is used in the following project work in our school:

*   P4 – P6 Social Studies Project Work
*   P3 & P4 Young Innovators’ Project (Science)
*   P5 Mathaquarium (Math)
