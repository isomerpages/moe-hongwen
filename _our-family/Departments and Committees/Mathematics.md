The objective of the programme is for all Primary 5 pupils to work in groups and to express their creativity and innovative thinking through game design. Pupils have to come out with their own game concept and infuse Mathematics in the games. On Mathaquarium Day, all projects are exhibited for the rest of the school to enjoy playing and learning.

**P5   4-in-1 Maths Cards (created by HWS teachers)**

Games such as the in-house created 4-in-1 Maths Cards  are used to enhance teaching and learning for topics such as Fractions, Decimals and Percentage.

#### **Other Programmes**

**P1 to P6 Weekly Maths Quiz**  

The aim of the Weekly Mathematics Quiz is to expose pupils to non-routine questions which emphasise on thinking and problem solving skills. Through this programme, pupils are equipped with the process skills that would help them handle higher-order mathematical problems. Pupils’ achievements are collated and outstanding pupils in every class are rewarded.

**P4, P5 & P6 Math Olympiad Training (MOT)** 

Pupils who excel in Mathematics are put through the MOT to stretch their potential further.

**School-Based Programmes infusing Mathematics**

Our P1-P5 students get to apply and see relevance in the Mathematics concepts learned during P1-P5 Integrated Learning Journey (ILJ).
