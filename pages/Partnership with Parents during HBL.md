We seek your partnership in supporting your child during his/her HBL by providing a conducive environment at home and ensuring that your child follows a regular routine for his/her learning. You could do this by:

*   Working out a daily schedule/routine with your child and guiding your child in setting goals and scheduling tasks. For further tips on guiding your child in setting goals, refer to the Resilience Boosters at [https://go.gov.sg/selresforparents](https://go.gov.sg/selresforparents).
*   Establishing an agreement with your child on managing screen time. We will assign a maximum of 2 hours of online learning every day. For further tips and guides on reinforcing your child’s cyber wellness, please refer to: [https://ictconnection.moe.edu.sg/cyber-wellness/for-parents](https://ictconnection.moe.edu.sg/cyber-wellness/for-parents).
*   Encouraging your child to maintain an optimistic and positive outlook while accepting the changes and emotions that he/she has had to face as part of going through HBL.
