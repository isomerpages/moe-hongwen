宏文学校即将在2023年10月28日至11月16日举办品德教育美展，展出地点为牛车水国家图书馆，开幕典礼订立在11月3日周五下午5点举行，届时欢迎阖家莅临。美展将以实体和在线两种方式呈现，民众不仅可现场观赏实体作品，亦可在家欣赏佳作。

从今年开始，宏文学校品德教育美展回归核心价值—品德，以学校六大价值观作为每一年的美展主题，希冀用艺术方式体现学校价值观。

关爱，是今年美展的主题，亦是宏文学校价值观之一。学生透过艺术创作，表达人们在生活中如何展现关爱，关爱的对象不仅局限于人，还包括动物与环境。透过美展，期许学生能多关注他人美好的一面，保持善良正向的心，为自己也为他人带来温暖。

学生、教师、校友以作品讲故事，以艺术创作的方式体现关爱的价值观，一同建立宏文学校友善校园的氛围。



Hong Wen School will be holding a Character Art Exhibition from 28 October to 16 November 2023. The venue of the exhibition is the Chinatown National Library. The Opening Ceremony is scheduled to be held at 5 pm on Friday, 3 November. We sincerely invite you to visit our HW exhibition.

In addition to the physical exhibition, Hong Wen School also offers an online exhibition, allowing the public to appreciate the artworks from the comfort of their homes.

Starting from this year, Hong Wen School's Character Art Exhibition returns to its core value - Character, using our school's six core values as the theme for each year's art exhibition. The theme for this year is "Compassion", which is also one of Hong Wen School's values. Through artistic creation, students express how people demonstrate compassion in their lives, with the focus not limited to humans but also encompassing animals and the environment. Through the art exhibition, we hope that students will pay more attention to the beauty in others, maintain a kind and positive heart, and bring warmth to themselves and others.

Students, teachers, and our school's alumni share stories through their artworks, using art as a means to embody the value of compassion. Collectively, we work to create a culture of kindness within the Hong Wen School community.
