Hong Wen School will be holding our annual Character Art Exhibition from 28 October to 16 November 2023 at Chinatown National Library. The Opening Ceremony is on 3 November, Friday, at 5 pm. We would like to extend our invitation to you to visit our exhibition. In addition to the physical exhibition, Hong Wen School also offers an online exhibition, allowing the public to appreciate the artworks from the comfort of their homes.

From this year, our Character Art Exhibition will focus on our school’s six core values, with one value to be used as the theme annually for the exhibition. For this year, we will adopt the value of "Compassion" as our theme. In their own artistic ways, students not only express their understanding of compassion observed in their everyday lives, but also their creative expressions of compassion in animals and the environment. We hope that our students will maintain a kind and positive mind, and focus on the beauty in others, bringing warmth to themselves and people around them.

Through their artworks, Character Art Exhibition presents the stories of our students, teachers and alumni on what compassion means to them. Together, we continue to instill the value of compassion in our students to build a more compassionate Hong Wen School community.

宏文学校即将在2023年10月28日至11月16日举办品德教育美展，展出地点为牛车水国家图书馆，开幕典礼订立在11月3日周五下午5点举行，届时欢迎阖家莅临。美展将以实体和在线两种方式呈现，民众不仅可现场观赏实体作品，亦可在家欣赏佳作。

从今年开始，宏文学校品德教育美展回归核心价值—品德，以学校六大价值观作为每一年的美展主题，希冀用艺术方式体现学校价值观。

关爱，是今年美展的主题，亦是宏文学校价值观之一。学生透过艺术创作，表达人们在生活中如何展现关爱，关爱的对象不仅局限于人，还包括动物与环境。透过美展，期许学生能多关注他人美好的一面，保持善良正向的心，为自己也为他人带来温暖。

学生、教师、校友以作品讲故事，以艺术创作的方式体现关爱的价值观，一同建立宏文学校友善校园的氛围。
