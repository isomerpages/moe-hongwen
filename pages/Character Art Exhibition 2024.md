<p>The Character Art Exhibition is a collaboration with the Hong Wen Alumni
Association (宏文校友会). It was first launched in November 2011 at The National
Library (Victoria Street).</p>
<p>The exhibition allows our pupils to showcase their artistic talents and
express themselves creatively, while engaging our School Alumni members
and fostering a closer relationship between all stakeholders.</p>
<p>The theme for this year is Celebrating Diverse Excellence [卓越105- 听见你心里的卓越<strong>]. </strong>By
celebrating the excellence within our students, they learn to affirm themselves
and become confident individuals. In turn, we hope they will recognize
their strengths and strive to realise their potential.</p>
