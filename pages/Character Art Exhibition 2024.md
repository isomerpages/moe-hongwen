<h2><strong>Character Art Exhibition 2024</strong></h2>
<h2><strong>品德教育美展</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>The theme for CAE 2024</strong></h4>
<h4><strong><em>Celebrating Diverse Excellence&nbsp;</em>|&nbsp;听见你心中的卓越</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<br>Every child is either demonstrating excellence or on the path toward achieving
it.</p>
<p>每一个孩子不是正展现卓越，就是在迈向卓越的路途上</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<br>Since 2023, The Hong Wen School's Character Education Art Exhibition places
emphasis on the school core value of character. Each year, the theme of
the exhibition reflects one of the six core values of the school, embodying
the values through art.</p>
<p>This year, the focus is on “Excellence”, one of the school core values.
Every child has his/her own definition of excellence. Excellence is not
limited to being the best but is about striving to achieve one's potential
in the pursuit of dreams and goals.</p>
<p>Every child possesses his/her own strengths, some achieving excellence,
some on the journey towards achieving excellence.&nbsp; This calls for
a celebration. Through the art exhibition, we encourage our children learn
to affirm themselves and become confident individuals – that Excellence
is beyond boundary!</p>

<p>宏文学校品德教育美展从2023年开始回归校本核心价值——品德，以学校六大价值观作为每一年的美展主题，希冀用艺术方式体现学校价值观。</p>
<p><strong>卓越</strong>，是今年美展主题，亦是宏文学校价值观之一。</p>
<p>每个孩子都有其独特的“卓越”，卓越并不仅限于成为群体中最好的那个，而是在追求梦想与目标的过程时，孩子能尽其所能去成就自己。</p>
<p>每个孩子都有自己的长处，有些不是正展现卓越，就是在迈向卓越的路途上，都值得被庆祝，我们肯定、看见、爱惜每位孩子的特点。透过美展，鼓励孩子听见自己心里的卓越，学习肯定自己，成为自信的自己。</p>
