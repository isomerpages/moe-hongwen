<p>Since its inception in 2005, the objectives of this competition have been
to promote the appreciation of Chinese culture through calligraphy, and
to provide a platform for students to showcase their calligraphy talents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This competition is jointly organized by Hong Wen School and the Hong
Wen Alumni Association. It provides an opportunity for students to compete,
share, and learn from one another while celebrating the Lunar New Year.
This year, we are also celebrating our school’s 105th anniversary, making
this event even more special.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The competition will be an on-the-spot event and will be held at Hong
Wen School. Details of the competition and registration have been sent
to your school. Registration closes on Friday, 24 January 2025.</p>
