The theme of our school’s Learning for Life Programme (Sports and Outdoor Education) is “Sports for Character, Sports for All”. It seeks to help pupils acquire an active lifestyle, develop strong character, and build social and emotional competencies through deep engagement in sports and outdoor activities. It leverages on the exposure and holistic learning experiences provided through the following cohort programmes throughout the school year.

*   Primary 3 – Wushu
*   Primary 4 – Swimming
*   Primary 5 – Frisbee
*   Primary 6 – Floorball

This is further augmented by our House System structure and the following supplementary programmes:
