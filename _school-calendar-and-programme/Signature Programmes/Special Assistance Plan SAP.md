Chinese Cultural Programme (CCP) is our school’s SAP flagship programme, where different aspects of Chinese Culture are infused into Chinese Language, Physical Education, Art and Music lessons. It reflects the emphasis the school places on fulfilling its mission of nurturing students to be ‘Rooted in Chinese Culture’. CCP aims to widen our students’ exposure to, and deepen their knowledge and appreciation of the Chinese Culture. It is designed based on the 4 domains of 琴、棋、书、画(Music, Chess, Calligraphy, Painting) and infused into the curriculum across all 6 levels. The programmes include Chinese Musical Instruments (Guzheng, Erhu and Chinese Drums), Chinese Chess (Xiangqi, Weiqi), Chinese Calligraphy, Chinese Painting, Speech and Drama, Chinese Tea Appreciation, Chinese Knots and Chinese Paper Cutting.
