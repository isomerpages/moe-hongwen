**Hong Wen School – CCA Policy**

CCA is an integral part of our pupils’ holistic education. It provides pupils with a platform to discover their interests and passions, and develop knowledge and skills in areas beyond academic curriculum.

CCA also offers excellent platforms for students to learn core values, social and emotional competencies and the emerging 21st century competencies.

The school offers a total of 17 CCAs in the following three groupings:

*   (i) Sports & Games
*   (ii) Aesthetics and Chinese Cultural, Arts-related
*   (iii) Clubs & Societies.

All Primary 3 to 6 pupils are to participate in at least one CCA.

Registration for CCA has opened for Primary 3 pupils from 7th – 14th Jan 2019.

Pupils are allowed to indicate up to 3 choices (one per grouping) during the CCA Registration Exercise.

Attendance is compulsory for all CCA sessions. An explanation in written form from parents, or a doctor’s medical certificate is required to be submitted to the teacher-in-charge whenever a pupil fails to attend a session.

A pupil’s CCA involvement will only be recognized and reflected in his/her holistic development report if he/she stays in the same CCA with at least 75% attendance for the entire CCA calendar year.

Pupils are encouraged to stay in a CCA. Change of CCA is not allowed unless for special reasons (e.g. medical condition), and is subjected to school’s approval.
