In PAL at Hong Wen, emphasis is placed on experiential learning through hands-on experiences which reinforce pupils’ learning, and allow them to explore, discover, generate further thinking and express their ideas. In every lesson, time is set aside for both individual work and team work.

The activities are fun and enjoyable, and are pitched at the capabilities of Primary 1 & 2 pupils. During the PAL lessons, pupils are given time to reflect on their experiences and feelings in different contexts. PAL provides an excellent platform for our children to acquire social and emotional competencies and inculcate good values.

All Primary 1 & 2 pupils will participate in PAL and experience the four domains of Sports and Games, Outdoor Education, Performing Arts (Music, Dance and Drama) and visual Arts over two years.

Ultimately, PAL seeks to equip our pupils with life skills and positive dispositions for the future – a sense of confidence; the ability to express themselves effectively; the connection within themselves and with others, guided by a set of values.
