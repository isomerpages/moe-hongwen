The Edusave Character Award (ECHA) was introduced by MOE to recognise pupils who demonstrate exemplary character and outstanding personal qualities through their behaviour and actions, and to send a clear and strong signal of the importance that MOE places on character and values, on par with achievements in the academic domain. The award also supports our school’s effort in nurturing pupils of good values and character, who are active contributors and concerned citizens.

**Eligibility Criteria**

1.  The award is given out to **Singaporean pupils** who have met the selection criteria and who have cleared the selection process. All Singaporean pupils are eligible **regardless of the level that they are in**.
2.  Pupils may be nominated regardless of their academic results provided that their weak academic results are not due to negative character traits but are attributed to difficulties that go beyond the control of the student.
3.  The nominated pupil must have demonstrated **good character and values** in a **consistent manner**. Pupils may be identified for the following types of qualities:

(a)          Qualities associated with **our school values (Respect, Responsibility, Resilience, Integrity, Compassion, Excellence)**

(b)          Demonstrated a high level of **civic responsibility**: Pupils must have demonstrated concerns about issues related to their community or issues faced by others. They could have initiated simple action or played an active role to address these issues and demonstrate commitment to making a difference; and/or

(c)           Qualities associated with **resilience**: Pupils who have persevered despite facing difficult circumstances (e.g. financial problems, health issues, family issues, peer resistance etc) and have managed to overcome the odds.
