1.  The Ministry of Education (MOE) had earlier implemented Home-Based Learning (HBL)[1](https://www.moe.gov.sg/news/press-releases/20211007-phased-resumption-of-face-to-face-lessons-for-primary-schools-from-11-october#footnote-1) in primary schools and Special Education (SPED) schools to reduce the possible disruption to the cohort taking the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) and as an additional precautionary measure. MOE will progressively bring Primary 1 to 6 students back to school for face-to-face lessons from Monday, 11 October 2021, to ensure physical schooling resumes in a safe manner. This is in line with our approach to minimise prolonged HBL where possible, for the socio-emotional well-being of students.
	
#### **Phased Resumption of Face-To-Face Classes**
	
1.  To ensure that Safe Management Measures (SMMs) can be implemented effectively as students return to school, MOE will phase the return of students next week:

Primary 3 to 6 students returning from Monday,  11 October.Primary 1 and 2 students to continue with HBL on  Monday, 11 and Tuesday, 12 October, and  return to school for face-to-face lessons  only from Wednesday, 13 October.
	
2. Should there be live lessons, it will take place at the fixed timeslot allocated for the respective level shown in the table below.

3. Please click on the level that your child is in to view the respective class HBL schedule and information on the teachers’ planned learning activities.  The HBL schedule for the individual classes will be available from 27 September 2021, 7.00 am and subsequent daily schedule will be updated at least 1 day in advance.
