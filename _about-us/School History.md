Founded in 1920 by Hin Ann Huay Kuan（兴安会馆）, Hong Wen School （宏文学校）was born out of the foresight of its founders who believed in the importance of education for the young,  as well as the promotion of Chinese language, culture and values.

In 1920, Mr Chen Yao Ru（陈耀如先生）, Mr Lin Zhi Cheng（林志成先生）, Mr Lin Hong Bin（林鸿宾先生）, Mr Li Hao（李好先生）, Mr Zheng Xian Bin（郑显斌先生）, Mr Guan Fu（关富先生）, Mr Chen Zong Fan（陈宗藩先生）, Mr Dai Zun（戴尊先生）, Mr Xue Wen Bin（薛文斌先生） from the Hing Hua dialect group initiated the setting up of the Hin Ann Huay Kwan at 133 Queen Street. Hong Wen School was founded in the same year with only fifty pupils. The school was headed by Mr Song Shao Lian（宋少濂先生）, founding Principal of the school.

In 1923, the school was closed due to economic recession. It reopened in 1925 under the leadership of the 2nd Principal, Mr Guo Zi Hui（郭子惠先生）. The school moved to 189 Waterloo Street the following year. The number of pupils had increased to more than a hundred. In the 1930s, the enrolment of the school increased steadily.

The school closed again in 1941 because of the Japanese Occupation. With the liberation of Singapore in 1945 and through the concerted efforts of the School Management Committee, the school functioned again in the same year in a rented building at 2 Dickson Road. Madam Lin Fang Lan（林芳兰女士） was appointed as the school’s 5th Principal.

In 1955, the school met with yet another crisis when it was ordered by the landlord to vacate the Dickson Road premise. The school community, led by the School Management Committee and principal, rallied together to raise funds and bought over the building from the landlord. Thus the crisis of having to vacate the premises was averted.

The school became a government-aided school in 1957. The enrolment of the school increased to more than a thousand. A number of classes had to be conducted in rented premises at Dunlop Street and Jalan Besar. The school also held classes in the evenings to overcome the space constraint.

In 1961, Mr Lin Jin Joo（林真如先生）was appointed 6th Principal of the school when his predecessor, Madam Lin Fang Lan, was posted to Nan Qiao High School as Principal. He was concerned about the school’s lack of facilities – there was neither a hall nor space for physical activities. He succeeded in converting the roof-top into multi-purpose hall for the pupils. The school held its first Sports Meet in Victoria School in 1965.

Mr Yeo Sing Cheng（杨先景先生）took over as the 7th Principal in 1973 when Mr Lin Jin Joo retired. At that time, the number of pupils started to decrease because many people in the neighbourhood shifted to the new housing estates. The School Management Committee saw the need to relocate the school, and subsequently obtained the land lease from the government for a piece of land along Victoria Street to construct a new building for the school.

The School Management Committee, together with the school community, raised more than two million dollars – thanks to the generosity of the parents, former pupils and the Hing Hua dialect group in Singapore and neighbouring countries. In addition to the grant of more than a million dollars from Ministry of Education, the school had a total of more than three million dollars for the new building.

The campus at 508 Victoria Street was finally completed in 1981. In the middle of the same year, the school moved into the new building which was officially declared open by Mr Ho Kah Leong, Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Education, on 10 September 1982.

The enrolment of the school increased and there were more than fifty teachers in the school. In 1982, the school had pre-primary classes. In the early 1980s, the school went through the transition from a Chinese medium school to one that offered English as first language and Chinese as a second language.

Mrs Yeo Soon Beng（黄美玲女士）was appointed 9th Principal of the school on 26 December 1990.

In May 1991, the pupils and teachers were inspired to achieve greater heights by the good news that Hong Wen School would join the rank of Special Assistance Plan (SAP) schools the following year. In 1992, the school was accorded the SAP school status,  offering both English and Chinese as first languages. As a SAP school, Hong Wen kept alive her best traditions and ethos, and continued to inculcate traditional Chinese values in her pupils as espoused in her school motto.
